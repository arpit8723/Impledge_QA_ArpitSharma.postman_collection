# Overview
This Postman collection includes tests for validating API functionality for the Impledge QA exercise. Below is a summary of the tests and modifications made.

Postman Test 01: Fix Failing Test Cases
In this test, I addressed failing assertions related to error handling in the response. The following changes were made:

# Test Case 1: "Response body has no errors"
This test ensures the response body doesn’t contain any unexpected errors. It checks if an error object exists and validates its code field if present.

javascript

    pm.test("Response body has no errors", function () {
    var jsonData = pm.response.json();
    
    if (jsonData.error) {
        pm.expect(jsonData.error.code).to.equal('ADDRESS.VERIFY.FAILURE');
    } else {
        pm.expect(jsonData.error).to.not.exist;
    }
    });
    
If the error field exists, it checks if the error code matches ADDRESS.VERIFY.FAILURE.
If there's no error, it verifies that the error field is absent.

# Postman Test 02: New Request – Get Shipment Details
The shipment ID shp_e0b570fd1d7d4b62bd206917eae5881a returned a 404 Not Found error: "The requested resource could not be found."

After discussing with the recruiter, I was given permission to create a new test shipment. I generated a new shipment ID and proceeded with the request.

New Shipment Data
json

    {
      "shipment": {
        "to_address": {
          "name": "John Doe",
          "street1": "123 Main Street",
          "city": "San Francisco",
          "state": "CA",
          "zip": "94105",
          "country": "US",
          "phone": "555-555-5555"
        },
        "from_address": {
          "name": "Jane Doe",
          "street1": "789 Elm Street",
          "city": "Los Angeles",
          "state": "CA",
          "zip": "90001",
          "country": "US",
          "phone": "555-555-5555"
        },
        "parcel": {
          "length": 10,
          "width": 8,
          "height": 4,
          "weight": 15
        },
        "mode": "test"
      }
    }

# Postman Test 03: Add Test Cases
For Test 03, I added the following test cases to validate the shipment details from the newly generated shipment ID:

1. Verify Rates Array Exists
This test checks that the rates array exists in the response.

javascript

    pm.test("Rates array exists", function () {
        pm.expect(pm.response.json().rates).to.be.an("array");
    });
    
2. Retail Rate Equals Expected Value
This test verifies if the retail_rate in the first rate element is equal to the expected value of 39.00.

javascript

    pm.test("Retail rate is equal to expected value", function () {
        const retailRate = pm.response.json().rates[0].retail_rate;
        pm.expect(retailRate).to.eql("39.00");
    });
    
3. Retail Rate Greater Than List Rate
This test ensures the retail_rate is greater than the list_rate for the first rate in the response.

javascript

    pm.test("Retail rate is greater than list rate", function () {
        const retailRate = pm.response.json().rates[0].retail_rate;
        const listRate = pm.response.json().rates[0].list_rate;
        pm.expect(parseFloat(retailRate)).to.be.greaterThan(parseFloat(listRate));
    });
These tests ensure that the rates returned by the EasyPost API are correct and meet the expected conditions.
